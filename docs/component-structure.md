## Component Structure

This document outlines best practices for structuring individual React components to enhance readability, maintainability, and reusability within your projects.

### Folder Structure

For each component, maintain a cohesive folder structure:

```sh
Button/
├── Button.tsx           # contains the JSX and logic for the Button component.
└── Button.module.css    # css module for scoped styles specific to the Button component.
```
